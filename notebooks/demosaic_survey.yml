    notes:
        - end-to-end image processing that enforce image priors as proximal operators and use ADMM/primal-dual for optimization
        - end-to-end reduces error introduced in each steps of image processing, as each stage is not independent
        - applied to demosaicing, denoising, deconvolution, and a variety of reconstruction tasks
    remark:
        - recontruction based, no need for large datasets
        - classical regularizers that have proven to work well
        - choice of prior is shown to influence performance, so the choice of prior is important but ad hoc
        - no principled ways to pick solver parameters, i.e. the weight of regularizers
        - nonconvexity of the regularizers makes the optimization not guaranteed to converge to global optimum

    notes:
        - demosacing+denoising as image restoration problem
        - method learngs efficient regularization by a variational energy minimization 
        - demosaicing performed in linear RGB space
        - adaptable to different CFA pattern
        - regularization is learnt from data
        - noise level is more realistic, i.e. Poisson + Gaussian
        - data fidelity term and image priors are learnt from data
    remark:
        - 200 training images, which seems reasonable

    notes:
        - data-driven (instead of hand-crafted priors) approach to demosaicing and denoising using deep neural nets
        - goal is to reduce computation speed and reduce artifacts
        - generated millions of sRGB images, mosaicked, and injected noise.
        - came up with new metrics for identifying hard patches
    remark:
        - requires 2.5M images, not really feasible

    notes:
        - unified objective function with hidden priors, optimized wth ADMM for demosaicing noisy bayer input
        - included 4 prior terms, i.e. smoothness TV, denoising CBM3D, cross-channel, interpolation-based priors
        - results showed ADMM based more robust to noise
    remark:
        - purely optimization based
        - however regularizers are pretty ad hoc

    notes:
        - replace regularizer in energy minimization methods (primal-dual hybrid gradient PDHG) with a denoising neural network
            - residual denoising network DnCNN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03981.pdf)
        - reduce problem-specific training (i.e. different images, different noise levels)
        - related work section detailed some theory, proofs on convergence of custom proximal algorithms
        - RED is motivated by the observation that proximal operator is equivalent to image denoising
        - method implemented in a DSL for proximal methods in processing images (http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrk/proximal.pdf)
    remark:
        - DnCNN trained with 400 images of size 180x180, larger dataset negligible performance increase
        - seem to claim that using neuralnets for regularizers is better

        - the method is general for any inverse problem, not just demosaicing, so performed worse than demosaicnet, but is better than flexISP

    notes:
        - iterative neural networks for efficient optimization (majorization minimization)

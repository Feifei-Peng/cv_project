    url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6392274
    contribution:
        - image restoration (denoising, deblurring, superresolution) as suppression of sparse coding noise
    observation:
        - maybe helpful to look into compressive sensing
        - performance quite good, RED compared its result with it

    code: https://github.com/image-science-lab/OneNet
    tag: [inverse problem, deep, proximal operators]
    contribution:
        - learn signal prior in the form of projection/proximal operator under ADMM framework to solve inverse problems
        - showed convergence criteria for projection operator to guide design of projection networks
    result:
        - convergence is shown experimentally, theory only introduced condition for convergence to stationary points
        - is robust to linear operators involved in inverse problem and to noise levels
        - projection network fails for challenging problems such as blockwise inpainting
    observation:
        - quite well written, explains motivation and design decisions in using neural nets
        - some experiments performed on MNISDT dataset
        - perhaps could find a neural network that satisfy the convexity constraints, 
            + i.e. convex neural networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07152.pdf)

    url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02862.pdf
    contribution:
        - use denoiser as regularization of inverse problems
        - image adaptive laplacian-based function that motivates the use of denoisers
        - assumptions of denoisers and proved convergence of results
        - achieved state of art image superresolution

    tag: [multispectral, demosaic, deep]
    contribution:
        - this method bilinearly interpolates the multispectral image, then apply a residual network to refine
        - 3d convolution where 3rd dimension is spectral
    observation:
        - CAVE multispectral imaging dataset (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/)

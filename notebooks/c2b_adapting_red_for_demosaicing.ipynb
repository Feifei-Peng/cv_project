    "- same with NCSR paper, restoring RGB image done by converting to YCbCr color-space, applying reconstruction algorithm on the luminance channel only, and then converting the result back to RGB domain\n",
    "    - suspect, RED just follows NCSR's procedure. Guessing it might not work well on RGB color-space, i.e. ratios R/G, B/G not maintined explicitly by the denoising prior $\\rho(\\bx)$. However, for structured light C2B images, there is no explicit ratio relationship between channels: each channel is equally important.\n",
    "    - Anyhow, just try the method on images on RGB color-space first and go from there.\n",
    "- NCSR is trained in a supervised manner, specifically on images contaminated with white Gaussian noise with a fixed noise-level\n",
    "    - may not be ideal when applied directly to C2B images: might need retraining\n",
    "    - be good to try median filter denoiser as well\n",
    "- NCSR denoiser is applied to luminance channel only\n",

    "- the resulting demosaiced image $x$ from RED+ADMM showed mosaiced pattern\n",
    "    - observed that regularization term drop very rapidly in a few iterations\n",
    "    - probably because setting $x_i=0$ for as many $i$ as possible is effective in reducing the value of the regularization term\n",
    "    - the reason that other reconstruction tasks such as superresolution does not experience similar problem is, i think, due to reason that each output pixel depends on 47 different input pixels whereas in demosaicing, each output pixel depends on 1 input pixel. For demosaicing, about 2/3 of pixels can be changed without affecting the $\\by$ under $\\bH$. These pixels could be safely set to 0 to reduce the value of regularization term. Same could not be said with other reconstruction deblurring\n",
    "    - try decreasing value of $\\lambda$: does not work, psnr still drops\n",
    "    - try incoporate the multiplexing matrix $\\bW$ into degradation operator $\\bH$, in hope that more input pixels is required to compute 1 output pixel\n",

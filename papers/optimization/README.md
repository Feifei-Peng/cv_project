    + conclusion 
        + simply replacing lower level problem with corresponding KKT condition yield a problem where the corresponding constraint quantification (Slater's) is not satisfied

    + general bilevel problem
        + constraint quantification 
        + optimality condition 
    + contribution
        + the reformulated single level programming problems (SLPP) can use KKT as substitute
            + assuming (partial) calmness conditions are satisifed
            + holds for 
                + problems with linear lower level problem 
                + minmax problem
        + uniformly sharp minimums => calmness
        + optimality condition for unconstrained lower level problem

	abstract = {We introduce Embedded {PS}, a new robust and accurate phase shifting algorithm for 3D scanning. The method projects only high frequency sinusoidal patterns in order to reduce errors due to global illumination effects, such as subsurface scattering and interreflections. The frequency set for the projected patterns is specially designed so that our algorithm can extract a set of embedded low frequency sinusoidals with simple math. All the signals, patterns high and embedded low frequencies, are used with temporal phase unwrapping to compute absolute phase values in closed-form, without quantization or approximation via {LUT}, resulting in fast computation. The absolute phases provide correspondences from projector to camera pixels which enable to recover 3D points using optical triangulation. The algorithm estimates multiple absolute phase values per pixel which are combined to reduce measurement noise while preserving fine details. We prove that embedded periodic signals can be recovered from any periodic signal, not just sinusoidal signals, which may result in further improvements for other 3D imaging methods. Several experiments are presented showing that our algorithm produces more robust and accurate 3D scanning results than state-of-the-art methods for challenging surface materials, with an equal or smaller number of projected patterns and at lower computational cost.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of automatically generating sequences of structured-light patterns for active stereo triangulation of a static scene. Unlike existing approaches that use predetermined patterns and reconstruction algorithms tied to them, we generate patterns on the fly in response to generic specifications: number of patterns, projector-camera arrangement, workspace constraints, spatial frequency content, etc. Our pattern sequences are specifically optimized to minimize the expected rate of correspondence errors under those specifications for an unknown scene, and are coupled to a sequence-independent algorithm for perpixel disparity estimation. To achieve this, we derive an objective function that is easy to optimize and follows from first principles within a maximum-likelihood framework. By minimizing it, we demonstrate automatic discovery of pattern sequences, in under three minutes on a laptop, that can outperform state-of-the-art triangulation techniques.},

These eﬀects introduce systematic and often signiﬁcant errors in the recovered shape. We introduce a structured light technique called Micro Phase Shifting, which overcomes these problems. The key idea is to project sinusoidal patterns with frequencies limited to a narrow, highfrequency band. These patterns produce a set of images over which global illumination and defocus eﬀects remain constant for each point in the scene. This enables high quality reconstructions of scenes which have traditionally been considered hard, using only a small number of images. We also derive theoretical lower bounds on the number of input images needed for phase shifting and show that Micro {PS} achieves the bound.},

	abstract = {Dense 3D reconstruction of extremely fast moving objects could contribute to various applications such as body structure analysis and accident avoidance and so on. The actual cases for scanning we assume are, for example, acquiring sequential shape at the moment when an object explodes, or observing fast rotating turbine’s blades. In this paper, we propose such a technique based on a one-shot scanning method that reconstructs 3D shape from a single image where dense and simple pattern are projected onto an object. To realize dense 3D reconstruction from a single image, there are several issues to be solved; e.g. instability derived from using multiple colors, and difﬁculty on detecting dense pattern because of inﬂuence of object color and texture compression. This paper describes the solutions of the issues by combining two methods, that is (1) an efﬁcient line detection technique based on de Bruijn sequence and belief propagation, and (2) an extension of shape from intersections of lines method. As a result, a scanning system that can capture an object in fast motion has been actually developed by using a high-speed camera. In the experiments, the proposed method successfully captured the sequence of dense shapes of an exploding balloon, and a breaking ceramic dish at 300–1000 fps.},

The similarity as well as the difference between the design of projection patterns and the design of optimal signals for digital communication are discussed. The design of K projection patterns for a structured light system with L distinct planes of light is shown to be equivalent to the placement of L points in a K dimensional space subject to certain constraints. optimal design in the {MSE} sense is defined, but shown to lead to an intractable multi-parameter global optimization problem. Intuitively appealing suboptimal solutions derived from the family of K dimensional space-filling Hilbert curves are obtained. Preliminary experimental results are presented.},

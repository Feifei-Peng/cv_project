  abstract = {While deep learning methods have achieved state-of-theart performance in many challenging inverse problems like image inpainting and super-resolution, they invariably involve problem-specific training of the networks. Under this approach, each inverse problem requires its own dedicated network. In scenarios where we need to solve a wide variety of problems, e.g., on a mobile camera, it is inefficient and expensive to use these problem-specific networks. On the other hand, traditional methods using analytic signal priors can be used to solve any linear inverse problem; this often comes with a performance that is worse than learning-based methods. In this work, we provide a middle ground between the two kinds of methods \textemdash{} we propose a general framework to train a single deep neural network that solves arbitrary linear inverse problems. We achieve this by training a network that acts as a quasi-projection operator for the set of natural images and show that any linear inverse problem involving natural images can be solved using iterative methods. We empirically show that the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods using wavelet sparsity prior while achieving performance comparable to specially-trained networks on tasks including compressive sensing and pixel-wise inpainting.},

  abstract = {We introduce coded two-bucket (C2B) imaging, a new operating principle for computational sensors with applications in active 3D shape estimation and coded-exposure imaging. A C2B sensor modulates the light arriving at each pixel by controlling which of the pixel's two ``buckets'' should integrate it. C2B sensors output two images per video frame\textemdash{}one per bucket\textemdash{}and allow rapid, fully-programmable, per-pixel control of the active bucket. Using these properties as a starting point, we (1) develop an image formation model for these sensors, (2) couple them with programmable light sources to acquire illumination mosaics, i.e., images of a scene under many different illumination conditions whose pixels have been multiplexed and acquired in one shot, and (3) show how to process illumination mosaics to acquire live disparity or normal maps of dynamic scenes at the sensor's native resolution. We present the first experimental demonstration of these capabilities, using a fully-functional C2B camera prototype. Key to this unique prototype is a novel programmable CMOS sensor that we designed from the ground up, fabricated and turned into a working system.},

  abstract = {SummaryFocus in the paper is on optimality conditions for bilevel programming problems. We start with a general condition using tangent cones of the feasible set of the bilevel programming problem to derive such conditions for the optimistic bilevel problem. More precise conditions are obtained if the tangent cone possesses an explicit description as it is possible in the case of linear lower level problems. If the optimal solution of the lower level problem is a PC 1-function, sufficient conditions for a global optimal solution of the optimistic bilevel problem can be formulated. In the second part of the paper relations of the bilevel programming problem to set-valued optimization problems and to mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints are given which can also be used to formulate optimality conditions for the original problem. Finally, a variational inequality approach is described which works well when the involved functions are monotone. It consists in a variational re-formulation of the optimality conditions and looking for a solution of the thus obtained variational inequality among the points satisfying the initial constraints. A penalty function technique is applied to get a sequence of approximate solutions converging to a solution of the original problem with monotone operators.},

  volume = {3},
  issn = {1935-8237},
  abstract = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas\textendash{}Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for {$\mathscr{l}$}1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations.},

Much like Newton's method is a standard tool for solving unconstrained smooth optimization problems of modest size, proximal algorithms can be viewed as an analogous tool for nonsmooth, constrained, large-scale, or distributed versions of these problems. They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical algorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed-form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpretations of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.},

BADMM provides a unified framework for ADMM and its variants, including generalized ADMM, inexact ADMM and Bethe ADMM. We establish the global convergence and the \$O(1/T)\$ iteration complexity for BADMM. In some cases, BADMM can be faster than ADMM by a factor of \$O(n/\textbackslash{}log(n))\$. In solving the linear program of mass transportation problem, BADMM leads to massive parallelism and can easily run on GPU. BADMM is several times faster than highly optimized commercial software Gurobi.},

  abstract = {Multisampled imaging is a general framework for using pixels on an image detector to simultaneously sample multiple dimensions of imaging (space, time, spectrum, brightness, polarization, etc.). The mosaic of red, green, and blue spectral filters found in most solid-state color cameras is one example of multisampled imaging. We briefly describe how multisampling can be used to explore other dimensions of imaging. Once such an image is captured, smooth reconstructions along the individual dimensions can be obtained using standard interpolation algorithms. Typically, this results in a substantial reduction of resolution (and, hence, image quality). One can extract significantly greater resolution in each dimension by noting that the light fields associated with real scenes have enormous redundancies within them, causing different dimensions to be highly correlated. Hence, multisampled images can be better interpolated using local structural models that are learned offline from a diverse set of training images. The specific type of structural models we use are based on polynomial functions of measured image intensities. They are very effective as well as computationally efficient. We demonstrate the benefits of structural interpolation using three specific applications. These are 1) traditional color imaging with a mosaic of color filters, 2) high dynamic range monochrome imaging using a mosaic of exposure filters, and 3) high dynamic range color imaging using a mosaic of overlapping color and exposure filters.},

Our findings suggest most existing works belong to the class of sequential demosaicing- i.e., luminance channel is interpolated first and then chrominance channels are reconstructed based on recovered luminance information. We report our comparative study results with a collection of eleven competing algorithms whose source codes or executables are provided by the authors. Our comparison is performed on two data sets: Kodak PhotoCD (popular choice) and IMAX high-quality images (more challenging). While most existing demosaicing algorithms achieve good performance on the Kodak data set, their performance on the IMAX one (images with varying-hue and high-saturation edges) degrades significantly. Such observation suggests the importance of properly addressing the issue of mismatch between assumed model and observation data in demosaicing, which calls for further investigation on issues such as model validation, test data selection and performance evaluation.},

  abstract = {We introduce a machine learning approach to demosaicing, the reconstruction of color images from incomplete color filter array samples. There are two challenges to overcome by a demosaicing method: 1) it needs to model and respect the statistics of natural images in order to reconstruct natural looking images and 2) it should be able to perform well in the presence of noise. To facilitate an objective assessment of current methods, we introduce a public ground truth data set of natural images suitable for research in image demosaicing and denoising. We then use this large data set to develop a machine learning approach to demosaicing. Our proposed method addresses both demosaicing challenges by learning a statistical model of images and noise from hundreds of natural images. The resulting model performs simultaneous demosaicing and denoising. We show that the machine learning approach has a number of benefits: 1) the model is trained to directly optimize a user-specified performance measure such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or structural similarity; 2) we can handle novel color filter array layouts by retraining the model on such layouts; and 3) it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, in some setups by 0.7-dB PSNR, faithfully reconstructing edges, textures, and smooth areas. Our results demonstrate that in demosaicing and related imaging applications, discriminatively trained machine learning models have the potential for peak performance at comparatively low engineering effort.},

  title = {Rethinking Color Cameras},
  abstract = {Digital color cameras make sub-sampled measurements of color at alternating pixel locations, and then ``demosaick'' these measurements to create full color images by up-sampling. This allows traditional cameras with restricted processing hardware to produce color images from a single shot, but it requires blocking a majority of the incident light and is prone to aliasing artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a computational approach to color photography, where the sampling pattern and reconstruction process are co-designed to enhance sharpness and photographic speed. The pattern is made predominantly panchromatic, thus avoiding excessive loss of light and aliasing of high spatial-frequency intensity variations. Color is sampled at a very sparse set of locations and then propagated throughout the image with guidance from the un-aliased luminance channel. Experimental results show that this approach often leads to significant reductions in noise and aliasing artifacts, especially in low-light conditions.},

Our system is flexible and we demonstrate it on regular Bayer images as well as images from custom sensors. In all cases, we achieve large improvements in image quality and signal reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

The demosaicing problem poses several challenges, e.g. zippering and false color artifacts as well as edge blur. In this work, we introduce a novel learning based method that can overcome these challenges. We formulate demosaicing as an image restoration problem and propose to learn efficient regularization inspired by a variational energy minimization framework that can be trained for different sensor layouts. Our algorithm performs joint demosaicing and denoising in close relation to the real physical mosaicing process on a camera sensor. This is achieved by learning a sequence of energy minimization problems composed of a set of RGB filters and corresponding activation functions. We evaluate our algorithm on the Microsoft Demosaicing data set in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structured similarity index (SSIM). Our algorithm is highly efficient both in image quality and run time. We achieve an improvement of up to 2.6 dB over recent state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This poses a great challenge in obtaining meaningful reconstructions and a special care for the efficient treatment of the problem is required. While there are several machine learning approaches that have been recently introduced to deal with joint image demosaicking-denoising, in this work we propose a novel deep learning architecture which is inspired by powerful classical image regularization methods and large-scale convex optimization techniques. Consequently, our derived network is more transparent and has a clear interpretation compared to alternative competitive deep learning approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms any previous approaches on both noisy and noise-free data. This improvement in reconstruction quality is attributed to the principled way we design our network architecture, which also requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the-art deep network solution. Finally, we show that our network has the ability to generalize well even when it is trained on small datasets, while keeping the overall number of trainable parameters low.},

In this paper, we show that such accumulation of errors can be easily averted by jointly performing demosaicing and super-resolution. To this end, we propose a deep residual network for learning an end-to-end mapping between Bayer images and high-resolution images. By training on high-quality samples, our deep residual demosaicing and super-resolution network is able to recover high-quality super-resolved images from low-resolution Bayer mosaics in a single step without producing the artifacts common to such processing when the two operations are done separately. We perform extensive experiments to show that our deep residual network achieves demosaiced and super-resolved images that are superior to the state-of-the-art both qualitatively and in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics.},

The paper presents two CNN models that learn end-to-end mappings between the mosaic samples and the original image patches with full information. In the case the Bayer color filter array (CFA) is used, an evaluation with ten competitive methods on popular benchmarks confirms that the data-driven, automatically learned features by the CNN models are very effective. Experiments show that the proposed CNN models can perform equally well in both the sRGB space and the linear space. It is also demonstrated that the CNN model can perform joint denoising and demosaicing. The CNN model is very flexible and can be easily adopted for demosaicing with any CFA design. We train CNN models for demosaicing with three different CFAs and obtain better results than existing methods. With the great flexibility to be coupled with any CFA, we present the first data-driven joint optimization of the CFA design and the demosaicing method using CNN. Experiments show that the combination of the automatically discovered CFA pattern and the automatically devised demosaicing method significantly outperforms the current best demosaicing results. Visual comparisons confirm that the proposed methods reduce more visual artifacts than existing methods. Finally, we show that the CNN model is also effective for the more general demosaicing problem with spatially varying exposure and color and can be used for taking images of higher dynamic ranges with a single shot. The proposed models and the thorough experiments together demonstrate that CNN is an effective and versatile tool for solving the demosaicing problem.},

The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t \textrightarrow {$\infty$} the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.},

  abstract = {Neighborhood filters are nonlocal image and movie filters which reduce the noise by averaging similar pixels. The first object of the paper is to present a unified theory of these filters and reliable criteria to compare them to other filter classes. A CCD noise model will be presented justifying the involvement of neighborhood filters. A classification of neighborhood filters will be proposed, including classical image and movie denoising methods and discussing further a recently introduced neighborhood filter, NL-means. In order to compare denoising methods three principles will be discussed. The first principle, ``method noise'', specifies that only noise must be removed from an image. A second principle will be introduced, ``noise to noise'', according to which a denoising method must transform a white noise into a white noise. Contrarily to ``method noise'', this principle, which characterizes artifact-free methods, eliminates any subjectivity and can be checked by mathematical arguments and Fourier analysis. ``Noise to noise'' will be proven to rule out most denoising methods, with the exception of neighborhood filters. This is why a third and new comparison principle, the ``statistical optimality'', is needed and will be introduced to compare the performance of all neighborhood filters. The three principles will be applied to compare ten different image and movie denoising methods. It will be first shown that only wavelet thresholding methods and NL-means give an acceptable method noise. Second, that neighborhood filters are the only ones to satisfy the ``noise to noise'' principle. Third, that among them NL-means is closest to statistical optimality. A particular attention will be paid to the application of the statistical optimality criterion for movie denoising methods. It will be pointed out that current movie denoising methods are motion compensated neighborhood filters. This amounts to say that they are neighborhood filters and that the ideal neighborhood of a pixel is its trajectory. Unfortunately the aperture problem makes it impossible to estimate ground true trajectories. It will be demonstrated that computing trajectories and restricting the neighborhood to them is harmful for denoising purposes and that space-time NL-means preserves more movie details.},

  abstract = {Much research has been devoted to the problem of restoring Poissonian images, namely for medical and astronomical applications. However, the restoration of these images using state-of-the-art regularizers (such as those based on multiscale representations or total variation) is still an active research area, since the associated optimization problems are quite challenging. In this paper, we propose an approach to deconvolving Poissonian images, which is based on an alternating direction optimization method. The standard regularization (or maximum a posteriori) restoration criterion, which combines the Poisson log-likelihood with a (non-smooth) convex regularizer (log-prior), leads to hard optimization problems: the log-likelihood is non-quadratic and non-separable, the regularizer is non-smooth, and there is a non-negativity constraint. Using standard convex analysis tools, we present sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of these optimization problems, for several types of regularizers: total-variation, frame-based analysis, and frame-based synthesis. We attack these problems with an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which belongs to the family of augmented Lagrangian algorithms. We study sufficient conditions for convergence and show that these are satisfied, either under total-variation or frame-based (analysis and synthesis) regularization. The resulting algorithms are shown to outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of speed and restoration accuracy.},

In spite of the sophistication of the recently proposed methods, most algorithms have not yet attained a desirable level of applicability. All show an outstanding performance when the image model corresponds to the algorithm assumptions but fail in general and create artifacts or remove image fine structures. The main focus of this paper is, first, to define a general mathematical and experimental methodology to compare and classify classical image denoising algorithms and, second, to propose a nonlocal means (NL-means) algorithm addressing the preservation of structure in a digital image. The mathematical analysis is based on the analysis of the "method noise," defined as the difference between a digital image and its denoised version. The NL-means algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal under a generic statistical image model. The denoising performance of all considered methods are compared in four ways; mathematical: asymptotic order of magnitude of the method noise under regularity assumptions; perceptual-mathematical: the algorithms artifacts and their explanation as a violation of the image model; quantitative experimental: by tables of L2  distances of the denoised version to the original image. The most powerful evaluation method seems, however, to be the visualization of the method noise on natural images. The more this method noise looks like a real white noise, the better the method.},

  abstract = {Model-based reconstruction is a powerful framework for solving a variety of inverse problems in imaging. In recent years, enormous progress has been made in the problem of denoising, a special case of an inverse problem where the forward model is an identity operator. Similarly, great progress has been made in improving model-based inversion when the forward model corresponds to complex physical measurements in applications such as X-ray CT, electron-microscopy, MRI, and ultrasound, to name just a few. However, combining state-of-the-art denoising algorithms (i.e., prior models) with state-of-the-art inversion methods (i.e., forward models) has been a challenge for many reasons. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework that allows state-of-the-art forward models of imaging systems to be matched with state-of-the-art priors or denoising models. This framework, which we term as Plug-and-Play priors, has the advantage that it dramatically simplifies software integration, and moreover, it allows state-of-the-art denoising methods that have no known formulation as an optimization problem to be used. We demonstrate with some simple examples how Plug-and-Play priors can be used to mix and match a wide variety of existing denoising models with a tomographic forward model, thus greatly expanding the range of possible problem solutions.},

  abstract = {Recovering images from corrupted observations is necessary for many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to perform progressive image recovery based on hybrid graph Laplacian regularized regression. We first construct a multiscale representation of the target image by Laplacian pyramid, then progressively recover the degraded image in the scale space from coarse to fine so that the sharp edges and texture can be eventually recovered. On one hand, within each scale, a graph Laplacian regularization model represented by implicit kernel is learned, which simultaneously minimizes the least square error on the measured samples and preserves the geometrical structure of the image data space. In this procedure, the intrinsic manifold structure is explicitly considered using both measured and unmeasured samples, and the nonlocal self-similarity property is utilized as a fruitful resource for abstracting a priori knowledge of the images. On the other hand, between two successive scales, the proposed model is extended to a projected high-dimensional feature space through explicit kernel mapping to describe the interscale correlation, in which the local structure regularity is learned and propagated from coarser to finer scales. In this way, the proposed algorithm gradually recovers more and more image details and edges, which could not been recovered in previous scale. We test our algorithm on one typical image recovery task: impulse noise removal. Experimental results on benchmark test images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Different from classical image priors which are defined before running the reconstruction algorithm, algorithm-induced priors are defined by the denoising procedure used to replace one of the two modules in the ADMM algorithm. Since such prior is not explicitly defined, analyzing the performance has been difficult in the past. 
Focusing on the class of symmetric smoothing filters, this paper presents an explicit expression of the prior induced by the ADMM algorithm. The new prior is reminiscent to the conventional graph Laplacian but with stronger reconstruction performance. It can also be shown that the overall reconstruction has an efficient closed-form implementation if the associated symmetric smoothing filter is low rank. The results are validated with experiments on image inpainting.},

Among many useful features, one critical feature of the ADMM algorithm is its modular structure which allows one to plug in any off-the-shelf image denoising algorithm for a subproblem in the ADMM algorithm. Because of the plug-in nature, this type of ADMM algorithms is coined the name "Plug-and-Play ADMM". Plug-and-Play ADMM has demonstrated promising empirical results in a number of recent papers. However, it is unclear under what conditions and by using what denoising algorithms would it guarantee convergence. Also, since Plug-and-Play ADMM uses a specific way to split the variables, it is unclear if fast implementation can be made for common Gaussian and Poissonian image restoration problems. In this paper, we propose a Plug-and-Play ADMM algorithm with provable fixed point convergence. We show that for any denoising algorithm satisfying an asymptotic criteria, called bounded denoisers, Plug-and-Play ADMM converges to a fixed point under a continuation scheme. We also present fast implementations for two image restoration problems on super-resolution and single-photon imaging. We compare Plug-and-Play ADMM with state-of-the-art algorithms in each problem type, and demonstrate promising experimental results of the algorithm.},

As diverse as these camera systems may be, slightly different variants of the underlying image processing tasks, such as demosaicking, deconvolution, denoising, inpainting, image fusion, and alignment, are shared between all of these systems. Formal optimization methods have recently been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art quality for many of these applications. Unfortunately, different combinations of natural image priors and optimization algorithms may be optimal for different problems, and implementing and testing each combination is currently a time-consuming and error-prone process. ProxImaL is a domainspecific language and compiler for image optimization problems that makes it easy to experiment with different problem formulations and algorithm choices. The language uses proximal operators as the fundamental building blocks of a variety of linear and nonlinear image formation models and cost functions, advanced image priors, and noise models. The compiler intelligently chooses the best way to translate a problem formulation and choice of optimization algorithm into an efficient solver implementation. In applications to the image processing pipeline, deconvolution in the presence of Poisson-distributed shot noise, and burst denoising, we show that a few lines of ProxImaL code can generate highly efficient solvers that achieve state-of-the-art results. We also show applications to the nonlinear and nonconvex problem of phase retrieval.},

  abstract = {Model-based optimization methods and discriminative learning methods have been the two dominant strategies for solving various inverse problems in low-level vision. Typically, those two kinds of methods have their respective merits and drawbacks, e.g., model-based optimization methods are flexible for handling different inverse problems but are usually time-consuming with sophisticated priors for the purpose of good performance; in the meanwhile, discriminative learning methods have fast testing speed but their application range is greatly restricted by the specialized task. Recent works have revealed that, with the aid of variable splitting techniques, denoiser prior can be plugged in as a modular part of model-based optimization methods to solve other inverse problems (e.g., deblurring). Such an integration induces considerable advantage when the denoiser is obtained via discriminative learning. However, the study of integration with fast discriminative denoiser prior is still lacking. To this end, this paper aims to train a set of fast and effective CNN (convolutional neural network) denoisers and integrate them into model-based optimization method to solve other inverse problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned set of denoisers not only achieve promising Gaussian denoising results but also can be used as prior to deliver good performance for various low-level vision applications.},

  abstract = {While variational methods have been among the most powerful tools for solving linear inverse problems in imaging, deep (convolutional) neural networks have recently taken the lead in many challenging benchmarks. A remaining drawback of deep learning approaches is their requirement for an expensive retraining whenever the specific problem, the noise level, noise type, or desired measure of fidelity changes. On the contrary, variational methods have a plug-and-play nature as they usually consist of separate data fidelity and regularization terms. In this paper we study the possibility of replacing the proximal operator of the regularization used in many convex energy minimization algorithms by a denoising neural network. The latter therefore serves as an implicit natural image prior, while the data term can still be chosen independently. Using a fixed denoising neural network in exemplary problems of image deconvolution with different blur kernels and image demosaicking, we obtain state-of-the-art reconstruction results. These indicate the high generalizability of our approach and a reduction of the need for problem-specific training. Additionally, we discuss novel results on the analysis of possible optimization algorithms to incorporate the network into, as well as the choices of algorithm parameters and their relation to the noise level the neural network is trained on.},

  abstract = {Removal of noise from an image is an extensively studied problem in image processing. Indeed, the recent advent of sophisticated and highly effective denoising algorithms lead some to believe that existing methods are touching the ceiling in terms of noise removal performance. Can we leverage this impressive achievement to treat other tasks in image processing? Recent work has answered this question positively, in the form of the Plug-and-Play Prior (\$P\^3\$) method, showing that any inverse problem can be handled by sequentially applying image denoising steps. This relies heavily on the ADMM optimization technique in order to obtain this chained denoising interpretation. Is this the only way in which tasks in image processing can exploit the image denoising engine? In this paper we provide an alternative, more powerful and more flexible framework for achieving the same goal. As opposed to the \$P\^3\$ method, we offer Regularization by Denoising (RED): using the denoising engine in defining the regularization of the inverse problem. We propose an explicit image-adaptive Laplacian-based regularization functional, making the overall objective functional clearer and better defined. With a complete flexibility to choose the iterative optimization procedure for minimizing the above functional, RED is capable of incorporating any image denoising algorithm, treat general inverse problems very effectively, and is guaranteed to converge to the globally optimal result. We test this approach and demonstrate state-of-the-art results in the image deblurring and super-resolution problems.},

In particular, we show that many of the expressions in the paper by Romano et al. hold only when the denoiser has a symmetric Jacobian, and we demonstrate that such symmetry does not occur with practical denoisers such as non-local means, BM3D, TNRD, and DnCNN. To explain the RED algorithms, we propose a new framework called Score-Matching by Denoising (SMD), which aims to match a "score" (i.e., the gradient of a log-prior). We then show tight connections between SMD, kernel density estimation, and constrained minimum mean-squared error denoising. Furthermore, we interpret the RED algorithms from Romano et al. and propose new algorithms with acceleration and convergence guarantees. Finally, we show that the RED algorithms seek a consensus equilibrium solution, which facilitates a comparison to plug-and-play ADMM.},

DIP offers a new approach towards the regularization of inverse problems, obtained by forcing the recovered image to be synthesized from a given deep architecture. While DIP has been shown to be effective, its results fall short when compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. In this work, we aim to boost DIP by adding an explicit prior, which enriches the overall regularization effect in order to lead to better-recovered images. More specifically, we propose to bring-in the concept of Regularization by Denoising (RED), which leverages existing denoisers for regularizing inverse problems.

For a given input, SC minimizes a quadratic reconstruction error with an L1 penalty term on the code. The process is often too slow for applications such as real-time pattern recognition. We proposed two versions of a very fast algorithm that produces approximate estimates of the sparse code that can be used to compute good visual features, or to initialize exact iterative algorithms. The main idea is to train a non-linear, feed-forward predictor with a specific architecture and a fixed depth to produce the best possible approximation of the sparse code. A version of the method, which can be seen as a trainable version of Li and Osher's coordinate descent method, is shown to produce approximate solutions with 10 times less computation than Li and Osher's for the same approximation error. Unlike previous proposals for sparse code predictors, the system allows a kind of approximate ``explaining away'' to take place during inference. The resulting predictor is differentiable and can be included into globallytrained recognition systems.},

Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases and has shown that, under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases, and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation, this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically, minimizing the {$\mathscr{l}$}1 norm of the coefficients {$\gamma\underbar$}. In this article, we obtain parallel results in a more general setting, where the dictionary D can arise from two or several bases, frames, or even less structured systems. We sketch three applications: separating linear features from planar ones in 3D data, noncooperative multiuser encoding, and identification of over-complete independent component models.},

  abstract = {Recovering high-resolution images from limited sensory data typically leads to a serious ill-posed inverse problem, demanding inversion algorithms that effectively capture the prior information. Learning a good inverse mapping from training data faces severe challenges, including: (i) scarcity of training data; (ii) need for plausible reconstructions that are physically feasible; (iii) need for fast reconstruction, especially in real-time applications. We develop a successful system solving all these challenges, using as basic architecture the recurrent application of proximal gradient algorithm. We learn a proximal map that works well with real images based on residual networks. Contraction of the resulting map is analyzed, and incoherence conditions are investigated that drive the convergence of the iterates. Extensive experiments are carried out under different settings: (a) reconstructing abdominal MRI of pediatric patients from highly undersampled Fourier-space data and (b) superresolving natural face images. Our key findings include: 1. a recurrent ResNet with a single residual block unrolled from an iterative algorithm yields an effective proximal which accurately reveals MR image details. 2. Our architecture significantly outperforms conventional non-recurrent deep ResNets by 2dB SNR; it is also trained much more rapidly. 3. It outperforms state-of-the-art compressed-sensing Wavelet-based methods by 4dB SNR, with 100x speedups in reconstruction time.},

We rely on a recursive algorithm, which alternates between a CNN based denoising step and enforcement of data consistency. Unrolling the recursive algorithm yields a deep network that is trained using backpropagation. The unique aspect of this method is the use of the same CNN weights at each iteration, which makes the resulting structure consistent with the model-based formulation. Also, this approach reduces the number of trainable parameters, which hence lower the amount of training data needed. The use of a forward model also reduces the size of the network and enables the exploitation additional prior information available from calibration data. The use of the framework for multichannel MRI reconstruction provides improved reconstructions, compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

In particular, most existing analyses are specific to unconstrained problems but cannot apply to the more general cases where some variables of interest are subject to certain constraints. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Linearized ADMM (D-LADMM) for solving the problems with linear constraints. Specifically, D-LADMM is a K-layer LADMM inspired deep neural network, which is obtained by firstly introducing some learnable weights in the classical Linearized ADMM algorithm and then generalizing the proximal operator to some learnable activation function. Notably, we rigorously prove that there exist a set of learnable parameters for D-LADMM to generate globally converged solutions, and we show that those desired parameters can be attained by training D-LADMM in a proper way. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide the convergence analysis for the learning-based optimization method on constrained problems.},

  abstract = {We present a variety of new architectural features and training procedures that we apply to the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. We focus on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the generation of images that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative models, our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data, nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3\%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.},

  abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

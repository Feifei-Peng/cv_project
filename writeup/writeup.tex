\section{Abstract}
We aim to improve upon low level image proecssing pipeline for the coded two-bucket camera. Specifically, we aim to jointly upsample, demultiplex, and denoise two-bucket images to produce full resolution images under different illumination conditions for downstream reconstruction tasks.


\section{The Two-Bucket Camera}

The coded two-bucket (C2B) camera is a pixel-wise coded exposure camera that outputs two images in a single exposure.~\cite{weiCodedTwoBucketCameras2018} Each pixel in the sensor has two photo-collecting site, i.e. the two \textit{buckets}, as well as a 1-bit writable memory controlling which bucket is actively collecting light. It was shown previously that C2B camera is capable of one-shot 3D reconstruction by solving a simpler image demosaicing and illumination demultiplexing problem instead of a difficult 3D reconstruction problem. We summarize the following notations relevant to discussion

Illumination ratios are albedo \textit{quasi-invariant}, a property which can be exploited for downstream processing
\[
    r = \frac{\bi^p[f]}{\bi^p[f] + \hat{\bi}^p[f]} 
    \quad\quad
    \hat{r} =   \frac{\hat{\bi}^p[f]}{\bi^p[f] + \hat{\bi}^p[f]} 
\]

\subsection{Subsampling Mapping}
Let $\bS \in \{1,2,\cdots,F\}^P$ be a vector specifying how the one-frame code tensor $\widetilde{\bC}$ is constructed, i.e.
\[
    \tilde{\bc}_1^{p} := \bc_{\bS_p}^p    
\]
for all pixels $p$. We can view $\bS$ as a mask to construct a \textbf{S}ubsampling linear map that maps vectorized two-bucket image sequences $\sI$ to the vectorized illumination mosaics $\bY$. In particular, let $\bA' \in \R^{P\times PF}$ and $\bA \in \R^{2P \times PF}$ be defined as follows 
\[
    \bA' =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{1\}}(\bS) } & \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{2\}}(\bS) } & \cdots & \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{F\}}(\bS) }
    \end{bmatrix}    
    \quad\quad 
    \bA = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bA' & \mathbf{0} \\
        \mathbf{0} & \bA' \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\]
Then we have the following relation between $\sI$ and $\bY$,
\[
    \vec{\bY} = \bA \vec{\sI}
\]
We are motivated to think of an analogue where it is common place to perform spatial subsampling. In RGB color imaging, bayer mosaics trade spatial resolution for spectral resolution (R,G,B colors). We can find an analogous one-frame code tensor which generate illuination mosaics that trade spatial resolution for temporal resolution ($1,2,\cdots,F$ frames). As an example in case of $F=3$ and $P=4$, the corresponding $\bS$, when reshaped to dimension of a $2\times 2$ image, and single image subsampling linear map $\bA'$ are simply
\[
    \bS = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 \\
        2 & 3
    \end{pmatrix}    
\]
\[
    \bA' = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{1\}}(\bS) } & \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{2\}}(\bS) } & \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{3\}}(\bS) }
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0 \\
        0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0 \\
        0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0 \\
        0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\]



\subsection{Image Formation}
Per-pixel image formation model is
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bi^p \\ \hat{\bi}^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bC^p \\ \overline{\bC}^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bl_1 \bt^p \\ \vdots \\ \bl_S \bt^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bC^p \\ \overline{\bC}^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    \si^p
\]
If bucket activity is same for all pixels and we use the optimal bucket multiplexing matrix $\bW$, then
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    \sI = \bX \bW^T
\end{equation}

\subsection{Image Processing Pipeline}
The reconstruction pipeline is as follows
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use $\widetilde{\bC}$ for bucket activities and capture the two-bucket image $\bY$
    \item upsample the images to full resolution images $\sI$
    \item demultiplex $\sI$ to obtain $S$ full resolution images $\bX$ as a least squares solution to a (\ref{eq:1})
    \item use $\bX$ to solve for disparity and albedo
\end{enumerate}
Step 2 and 3 are critical to downstream reconstuctions. When $S=3,S=4$ and $\bS$ being analogous to bayer mask, we can upsample the images using standard demosaicing algorithms. However, it is not immediately obvious to extend demosaicing methods to support arbitrary $\bS$, or more specifically, for scenarios where the spatial subsampling scheme is not bayer and when number of frames is not 3. 


\section{Inverse Problem Formulation}



The problem of image demosaicing and illumination demultiplexing can be considered as a standard linear inverse problem.
